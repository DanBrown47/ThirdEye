    <h2 style="text-align:center"> <b>THIRD EYE</b> - THREAT DETECTION SYSTEM </h3>
    <br>
    <br>

  <p style="text-align:left"><b>PROBLEM STATEMENT</b><p>
    <p style="text-align:left">
      The system is built for net security of the society and citizens.
    The current system is based on manual identification of criminals, which cannot be taken in a much effective way as humans can have limitations on processing multiple points of identification including face, facial features, visible marks, skin colour and so forth.
    Apart from criminals, convicts and runaways or kidnapping are becoming frequent this system can aid future policing in a more desirable and satisfactory way. Technological advancement can aid this system. With the cooperation of both Human Intelligence and Artificial Intelligence, society can be ordered more peacefully and crime rates might reduce significantly.
    </p>

   <p style="text-align:left"><b>PROBLEM SCOPE</b></p>
    <p style="text-align:left">
    The National Crime bureau suggests 63% of violent crimes are committed by just 1 % of the population.
    The purpose of the project is to Identify the convicts or run away peoples. This system is designed to fit into relatively small equipment which can be installed on public places and places people gather which can keep track of the peoples and innocent people data is not stored keeping privacy of common people intact. This can also aid in hospitals and private companies to ensure security. The project scope can again be extended to finding peoples after committing a crime.
